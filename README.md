# FanMenu

This project is just some kind of menu that stores sports fans information. It can load in fans from multiple text files, find fans in the database, remove fans from the database, spend the fans money, and process multiple commands all in one go. NOTE: I did not make the parser but I made the rest.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./fans

You can also give it a textfile to input fan data into the database

:$ ./fans -i "input file"

or give it the name of an output file to use

:$ ./fans -o "output file"

or you can do both (just have -i before the input file and -o before the output file).
